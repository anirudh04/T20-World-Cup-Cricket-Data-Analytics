# T20 World Cup Cricket Data Analytics

# Overview
This project focuses on conducting data analytics on T20 World Cup cricket data to identify the top 11 players for assembling a fantasy cricket team.


# Data Collection
- Cleaning and transforming the raw data into structured CSV files using Pandas in Python.
- Loading the CSV files into a Power BI model and creating an interactive dashboard for analyzing player metrics such as batting average, strike rate, economy rate, and more.
- Utilizing dashboard filters to select the top performers in various playing categories, including openers, middle-order batsmen, finishers, all-rounders, and bowlers, based on their statistics.
- Assembling the top 11 players into a fantasy team with a high probability of winning T20 matches.

# Data Cleaning and Transformation

- Column names were cleaned, null values were handled, and data types were transformed as necessary.
- Dataframes were joined to associate player names with their corresponding statistics.
- Cleaned data was saved as CSV files for importing into Power BI.

# Power BI Modeling and Visualization
- Cleaned CSV files were imported into Power BI to establish an analytical model.
- Relationships were established between match data, batting and bowling performance, and player data.
- Calculated columns were added for metrics like strike rate, economy rate, and batting average.
- Interactive visualizations, including bar charts, cards, and slicers, were created to analyze player performance.
